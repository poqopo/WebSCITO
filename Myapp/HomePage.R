         method that combines split-pool methods and droplet single-cell combinatorial sequencing (dsc-seq). By 
         combining antibody barcodes with pool barcodes, SCITO-seq enables combinatorially indexed dsc-seq of 
         antibodies, allowing the analysis of 100K-1M cells per reactionâ€”a significant improvement over
